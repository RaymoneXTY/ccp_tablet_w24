            <p>Bangkok, Thailand's capital, is a large city known for ornate shrines and vibrant street life. It is officially known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon and colloquially as Krung Thep.</p>
            <p>Bangkok welcomes more visitors than any other city in the world and it doesnâ€™t take long to realize why. Bangkok is a city of contrasts with action at every turn. Marvel at the gleaming temples, catch a tuk tuk through bustling Chinatown or take a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok highlight, from local dishes served at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop restaurants.</p>
